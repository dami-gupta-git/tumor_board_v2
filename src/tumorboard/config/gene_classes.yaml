# Gene Class Configuration
#
# This file defines gene-level properties for tier classification when
# variant-specific evidence is lacking. Unlike variant_classes.yaml (which
# matches variants to FDA approvals), this file captures gene-level
# therapeutic implications.

# DNA Damage Repair (DDR) genes
# Loss-of-function in these genes creates synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors
# and increases sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy

  description: "DNA Damage Repair genes with therapeutic implications via synthetic lethality"
  genes:
    - ATM
    - BRCA1
    - BRCA2
    - PALB2
    - CHEK2
    - RAD51C
    - RAD51D
    - BRIP1
    - FANCA
    - RAD51B
    - BARD1
    - CDK12
    - NBN
    - RAD50
    - MRE11
  therapeutic_implications:
    drugs:
      - PARP inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, talazoparib)
      - Platinum agents (cisplatin, carboplatin)
    mechanism: >
      Loss-of-function mutations in DDR genes impair homologous recombination
      repair, creating synthetic lethality with PARP inhibition. These tumors
      are also typically platinum-sensitive.
  tier_rules:
    # When CIViC has both Level A/B sensitivity AND resistance evidence
    # Example: ATM + PARP inhibitors show sensitivity in some contexts but
    # clinical trials (e.g., PROfound) showed no benefit in ATM subgroup
    conflicting_evidence: "II-C"
    # When only high-quality (Level A/B) sensitivity evidence exists
    sensitivity_only: "II-D"
    # When only preclinical/case report (Level C/D) evidence exists
    preclinical_only: "II-D"

# Mismatch Repair (MMR) genes
# Loss leads to MSI-H phenotype which predicts immunotherapy response
mmr:
  description: "Mismatch Repair genes - loss leads to MSI-H and immunotherapy sensitivity"
  genes:
    - MLH1
    - MSH2
    - MSH6
    - PMS2
    - EPCAM  # Deletions can silence MSH2
  therapeutic_implications:
    drugs:
      - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab)
    mechanism: >
      Loss of MMR function leads to microsatellite instability (MSI-H),
      increased tumor mutational burden, and neoantigen formation.
      MSI-H tumors have FDA-approved tumor-agnostic indication for
      pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA).
  tier_rules:
    # MMR loss typically has FDA approval via MSI-H, so this is fallback
    conflicting_evidence: "II-C"
    sensitivity_only: "II-B"  # Higher tier due to tumor-agnostic approval
    preclinical_only: "II-D"

# Splicing Factor genes
# Recurrent mutations in MDS/AML with emerging therapeutic implications
splicing:
  description: "Splicing factor genes with diagnostic/prognostic significance in MDS/AML"
  genes:
    - SF3B1
    - SRSF2
    - U2AF1
    - ZRSR2
  therapeutic_implications:
    drugs:
      - Luspatercept (SF3B1-mutant MDS)
      - Splicing modulators (investigational)
    mechanism: >
      Splicing factor mutations are defining features of MDS subtypes.
      SF3B1 mutations predict response to luspatercept and favorable
      prognosis. Other splicing mutations have prognostic implications.
  tier_rules:
    conflicting_evidence: "II-C"
    sensitivity_only: "II-C"  # Often prognostic, less therapeutic
    preclinical_only: "III-C"
